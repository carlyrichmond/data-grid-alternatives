This repository contains the accompanying examples for the talk *Oh No! Not Another Data Grid*. This talk has been presented in several forms at the following forums:

1. LJC Lightning Talks

For any questions feel free to contact the author [via the handles listed on her GitHub profile](https://github.com/carlyrichmond).

## Frameworks and Tools

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It makes use of React class components.

At time of writing this repository contains the following examples:

1. Time Series Line Chart: a simple line chart utilising [Highcharts](https://www.highcharts.com/)
2. Pivot Table: a simple implementation of [AG Grid](https://www.ag-grid.com/), making use of their [pivot capabilities](https://www.ag-grid.com/react-data-grid/pivoting/). Note that pivoting is an enterprise feature, which requires a licence. The control is used in evaluation mode using some of AG Grid's own sample medal data.

## Getting Started

Once cloned, the project can be built locally using the following commands:

```
npm install
npm run start
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
